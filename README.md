# TadPole

Tadpole is a script that leverages [GrayHatWarFare]("https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com") to download files out of open AWS buckets. 

Why the name tadpole? Well:
```bash
     t
     A WS
     D Ownload
     p 
     O Pen
     l 
buck E ts 
```

Yeah, not very creative I know. But like a tadpole this program can kinda swim.

# Installation

To install the program you will need `Python2.7` (3.x coming soon); and you will need to install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
That's all there is to it!

_NOTE_: _Tadpole is in the early stages of development. It is not finished, nor close to being finished, it works, but there are some bugs. If you find a bug feel free to open a issue or create a pull request._
